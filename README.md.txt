# Dynamic Quote Generator

## Introduction
This project is a dynamic quote generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays random quotes, allows users to share quotes on Twitter, and offers different theme options to enhance user experience.

## Features
1. Random Quote Generation: Generates a random quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked.
2. Share on Twitter: Share the current quote directly on Twitter with the "Share on Twitter" button.
3. Multiple Themes: Select from four different themesâ€”Classic, Minimalist, Colorful, and Dark.
4. Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Files Included
1. index.html: The main structure of the web page.
2. styles.css: The CSS file for styling the quote generator and different themes.
3. script.js: The JavaScript file that powers the functionality, including random quote generation, theme switching, and Twitter sharing.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote.
3. To share the quote on Twitter, click the "Share on Twitter" button.
4. Choose from the different themes by clicking on any of the theme buttons at the bottom.

## Theme Options
- Classic: A standard white background with black text.
- Minimalist: A light grey background with a clean design.
- Colorful: A vibrant theme with a random color for each quote.
- Dark: A dark theme with white text for a modern look.

## How It Works
- The JavaScript function `getNewQuote()` selects a random quote from the predefined array of quotes.
- The `shareQuoteBtn` adds the functionality to tweet the current quote.
- Users can change the theme of the page by clicking one of the theme buttons. If the "Colorful" theme is selected, the text color of the quote will change randomly.

## Customization
Feel free to add more quotes in the JavaScript file or change the existing ones. You can also add more themes or modify the existing styles in `styles.css`.

## Conclusion
This dynamic quote generator is a simple yet functional project that can be expanded with additional features, such as fetching quotes from an API or adding more theme options.
